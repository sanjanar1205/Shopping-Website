Shopping Website Using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and PHP
I have created a basic e-commerce website for practice purposes only.
There are 6 HTML pages. The first page is the home page which is connected with other 5 pages.
After clicking the home page, a login and signup page will appear where the user first has to fill in their details then only they can go to the main page and their data will be saved in the database for which I used PHP, where I created different categories of clothes, and these categories are directly linked with the big shopping website.
This will benefit user because our website will provide them with big discounts on their purchase. They will discount us because we have collaborated with these brands. There is an About page which will tell the user about our page and vision. Last but not least a membership page that users can join and connect with us. And I styled my demo website with CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
